# Section 1

## Problem 

**For this challenge, you will be asked to answer questions based on
arrest incidents data of the city of Los Angeles. Information of the
data set can be found
[here](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Arrest-Data-from-2010-to-Present/yru6-6re4)
and the download link is
[here](https://data.lacity.org/api/views/yru6-6re4/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD). Each
row in the data represents the booking of an arrestee. Only consider
data prior to January 1, 2019. For some questions, we specify a given
date range to consider.**

## Questions

### Question 1
**How many bookings of arrestees were made in 2018?**

``` python
104040
```


### Question 2
**How many bookings of arrestees were made in the area with the most arrests in 2018?**

``` python
10929
```

### Question 3
**What is the 95% quantile of the age of the arrestee in 2018?**

* Only consider the following charge groups for your analysis: Vehicle Theft,
Robbery, Burglary, Receive Stolen Property.

``` python
52.0000000000
```


### Question 4
**There are differences between the average age of an arrestee for the
various charge groups. Are these differences statistically significant?**

* For this question, calculate the Z-score of the average age for each
charge group. Report the largest absolute value among the calculated
Z-scores.
* Only consider data for 2018. Do not consider "Pre-Delinquency" and
"Non-Criminal Detention" as these charge groups are reserved for
minors.
* Exclude any arrests where the charge group description is not
known.

``` python
2.174336627804518
```

### Question 5
Felony arrest incidents have been dropping over the years. **Using a
trend line (linear estimation) for the data from 2010 and 2018
(inclusive), what is the projected number of felony arrests in 2019?**

* Round to the nearest integer.
* Note, the data set includes arrests for misdemeanor, felonies, etc.

``` python
95230
```

### Question 6
**How many arrest incidents occurred within 2 km from the Bradbury
Building in 2018?**

* Use (34.050536, -118.247861) for the coordinates of the Bradbury Building.
* For simplicity, please use the spherical Earth projected to a plane
equation for calculating distances. Use the radius of the Earth as 6371
km. Note, some arrest records are missing location data and the location
is listed as (0, 0). These records should not factor in your
calculation.

``` python
11436
```

### Question 7
**How many arrest incidents were made per kilometer on Pico Boulevard
during 2018?**

* For this question, we will need to estimate the length of
Pico Boulevard, which mostly stretches from east to west. To estimate
the length of Pico Boulevard:
* Consider all location data which the listed address mentions "Pico".
* Remove outliers by filtering out locations where either the latitude or
longitude is 2 standard deviations beyond the mean of the subset of
identified points.
* To estimate the length, calculate the distance from the most western and
eastern coordinate points. As before, use the simplified flat surface
equation.
* Once you have estimated the length of Pico Boulevard, you can proceed to
report the number of arrest incidents per kilometer on Pico Boulevard in 2018.

``` python
16.650914646737895
```

### Question 8
Some types of **arrest incidents in certain areas occur at a highly
disproportionate rate compared to their frequency city-wide**. For
example, let's say that the rate of larceny arrests (charge group code
6) is 1% in Devonshire (area ID 17). This rate may appear low but what
if larceny arrests constitute 0.1 % city-wide? The ratio between these
two probabilities is 10 and we can say that larceny occurs unusually
often in Devonshire (Note, these numbers were made up for illustration
purposes). **Calculate this ratio for all charge group code and area ID
pairs**. You can view this ratio as the ratio of the conditional
probability of an arrest incident of a charge group code given that it
occurred in an area ID to the unconditional probability of the arrest
incident of a charge group. **Report the average of the top 5 of the
calculated ratio.**

* Consider all records prior to January 1, 2019.
* Some arrest incidents don't have a charge group code. These records
should not be considered in your analysis.
* Arrest incidents for charge group code 99 should not be considered in
your analysis.
