# Data incubator challenge // project

Propose a project to do while at The Data Incubator. We want to know
about your ability to think at a high level. Try to think of projects
that users or businesses will care about that are also relatively
unanalyzed. Here are some useful links about data sources [on our
blog](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/tag/data-sources/) as well as the
archive of data sources on Data is Plural. You can see some final
projects of previous Fellows [on our YouTube
Page](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOE4k9MRzZanWmZ7MBrJFi7ZekYmVqEIV).

Propose a project that uses a large, publicly accessible
dataset. Explain your motivation for tackling this problem, discuss the
data source(s) you are using, and explain the analysis you are
performing. At a minimum, you will need to do enough exploratory data
analysis to convince someone that the project is viable and generate two
interesting non-trivial plots supporting this. *The most impressive
applicants have even finished a "rough draft" of their projects and have
derived non-obvious meaningful conclusions from their data*. Explain the
plots and give url links to them. For guidance on how to choose a
project, check out [this blog
